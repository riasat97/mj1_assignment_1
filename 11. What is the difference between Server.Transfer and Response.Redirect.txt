Both Response.Redirect and Server.Transfer methods are used to transfer a user from one web page to another web page. 
Both methods are used for the same purpose,  But the way they do this transfer / redirect is very different.


in “server.transfer”, the transfer is done by the server while In “response.redirect”, the transfer is done by the browser 

in “server.transfer”, Browser URL does not change while 
In “response.redirect”,	Changes to the redirected target page.


use “server.transfer” when Redirect between pages of the same server.
use “response.redirect” when Redirect between pages on different server and domain.
