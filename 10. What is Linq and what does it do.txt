Query (LINQ), is a component released within the .NET 3.5 Framework.It stands for Language Integrated Query.
It's like a query language which can query any data source .

LINQ comprises a series of operators, which are used to query, filter and project data in arrays,
enumerable classes, relational databases and XML. In order to query data, the data needs to be encapsulated as an object.
it treats the data source as an Object, rather than a Database. 

LINQ may query any type of data source, like:
LINQ querying SQL (MS SQL Server supported).
LINQ querying Datasets (Querying is possible on Datasets and DataTables)
LINQ querying ORM Solution
LINQ querying Objects (In-memory data may be queried)
LINQ querying XML (Querying is possible on XML data source
LINQ supports querying to those objects that implement the IEnumerable Interface.

Why:

makes it easy to query any data sources. 
allows to write queries directly in your code
It also provides full type safety and compile time checking. 
.NET Framework includes libraries that allow anyone to create a LINQ provider that can query any data source. 
LINQ providers that make it easy to query specialized data sources.
